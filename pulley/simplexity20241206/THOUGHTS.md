1. Front-end Enhancement
   - Improve the user interface and experience
   - Consider adding features like conversation history
	 	- Have more of a conversation flow, display the entire message_history
		- Display the chat tab vs. the sources tab

2. Back-end Optimization
   - Improve error handling and reliability: (3rd party api fails, out of limit, etc...)
   - Add caching mechanisms (how to cache this? semantic vs. lru exact match vs sth offered by 3rd party openai/anthropic)
   - Optimize API calls 
   - Consider adding rate limiting

3. AI/Search Capabilities
   - Enhance the quality of search results (getting user info?: geolocation, age, ... whatever google keep tracks of you to serve ads)
   - Improve the summarization (tweaking prompt?)
   - Add source validation
   - Consider adding memory or context

During our interview, we'll work together to identify and implement improvements in one or more of these areas. There's no "right" answer - we're interested in seeing your thought process, coding style, and how you approach enhancing real-world applications.

## Preparation

1. Review the code and get it running locally using the instructions in README.md
2. Think about which areas you'd find most interesting to improve
3. Come prepared with questions and ideas for discussion

We look forward to collaborating with you on this challenge!
