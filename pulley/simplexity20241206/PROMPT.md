# Simplexity Challenge

Welcome to the Simplexity technical challenge! This is a simplified clone of Perplexity (https://perplexity.ai) that demonstrates the basic concepts of building an AI-powered search application. The current implementation provides a foundation, but intentionally leaves room for enhancement across multiple dimensions.

## The Challenge

Your task is to explore and enhance this application during our upcoming interview. The code base is intentionally basic, providing opportunities for improvement in several areas:

1. Front-end Enhancement
   - Improve the user interface and experience
   - Add loading states and error handling
   - Implement real-time updates
   - Consider adding features like conversation history

2. Back-end Optimization
   - Improve error handling and reliability
   - Add caching mechanisms
   - Optimize API calls
   - Consider adding rate limiting

3. AI/Search Capabilities
   - Enhance the quality of search results
   - Improve the summarization
   - Add source validation
   - Consider adding memory or context

During our interview, we'll work together to identify and implement improvements in one or more of these areas. There's no "right" answer - we're interested in seeing your thought process, coding style, and how you approach enhancing real-world applications.

## Preparation

1. Review the code and get it running locally using the instructions in README.md
2. Think about which areas you'd find most interesting to improve
3. Come prepared with questions and ideas for discussion

We look forward to collaborating with you on this challenge!
