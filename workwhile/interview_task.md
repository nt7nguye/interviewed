## Interview Task: Worker Schedule Feature

For optimal job recommendations, WorkWhile needs to know of a worker's schedule.
Your task is to work on a feature where workers can inform WorkWhile of their schedule. Here are some product requirements for this feature.

- Worker can add, view and edit their schedule, represented by time periods where workers have other obligations and cannot take a shift with WorkWhile.
- The stored schedule will then be used by WorkWhile to find available workers for a shift and to filter out shifts that conflict with a worker's schedule.


### 1) Design UI/UX

Design an intuitive user experience for worker to add, view and edit their schedule. 

Describe what the user interface might look like.

### 2) Design database and APIs

Outline the APIs that will need to be exposed for part 1).

### 3) Code up a small library function

Prompt will be given after the first two parts are completed. We will make sure to leave at least 20 minutes for this part.
